      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
       <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element </li>
       <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside the element</li>
       <li>CSS defines the colors, visual layout, aesthetics and organization of a webpage</li>
       <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS, inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
       <li>An example of inline CSS is using the style attribute to change the color of a single h1 heading</li>
       <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element</li>
       <li>The most common way to style a webpage is using external style sheets</li>
       <li>This is preferred because it allows developers to keep their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
       <li>Separation of Concerns refers to separating code into different files based on use</li>
       <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
       <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
       <li>The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer</li>
       <li>The padding property adds space inside of an element. Increasing padding increases the entire size of the element</li>
       <li>A class attribute allows you to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class sector</li>
       <li>Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned to the CSS rule</li>
