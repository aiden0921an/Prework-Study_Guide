# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is a prework study guide that I have created for my coding bootcamp. This was my first coding project that I've done. I was a total rookie to coding when starting the bootcamp, and these notes have been a great study resource. This study guide will contain notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
