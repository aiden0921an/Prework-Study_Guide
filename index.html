            <ul>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
            <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage, which is extremely important for SEO</li>
            <li>The style element defines the CSS files associated with a webpage</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
       <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element </li>
       <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside the element</li>
       <li>CSS defines the colors, visual layout, aesthetics and organization of a webpage</li>
       <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS, inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
       <li>An example of inline CSS is using the style attribute to change the color of a single h1 heading</li>
       <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element</li>
       <li>The most common way to style a webpage is using external style sheets</li>
       <li>This is preferred because it allows developers to keep their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
       <li>Separation of Concerns refers to separating code into different files based on use</li>
       <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
       <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
       <li>The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer</li>
       <li>The padding property adds space inside of an element. Increasing padding increases the entire size of the element</li>
       <li>A class attribute allows you to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class sector</li>
       <li>Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned to the CSS rule</li>
     </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Git is a tool taht allows devs to use version control</li>
       <li>git status: checks which branch we are currently on</li>
       <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
       <li>A repository or repo is a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored</li>
       <li>Markdown or .md is a way to create content using plaintext that easily converts to HTML</li>
       <li>A Pull request or PR is a request for changes made within one branch to be merged onto another</li>
       <li>Issues allow users to bug and issue reporting and tracking</li>
       <li>A wiki is a section of a repo made for hosting documentation. Sometimes this info is stored within the READEME files instead</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
       <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
       <li>The const keyword allows us to create variables that can’t be reassigned a value</li>
       <li>After the const keyword, we’ll want to give it a name. This name must be unique because this is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code</li>
       <li>The assignment operator = assigns the specific data we want stored within our variable</li>
       <li>The console.log method is used to output a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
       <li>Console refers to a test environment that devs use to check out their code. The second part, .log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer</li>
       <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true</li>
       <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets</li>
       <li>If the condition isn’t true or has a value that isn’t truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on</li>
       <li>In JS we can have more than once condition by using else if</li>
       <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal</li>
       <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related</li>
       <li>To create an array we declare a variable in the same way as when we declared a variable with only one data item. We use const and give the variable a name, however we assign the variable to a group of values</li>
       <li>Being able to store a group of data in an array is a core feature of JS. Arrays are useful when you want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once</li>
       <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
       <li>The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array</li>
       <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run</li>
       <li>You must call a function by name in order to execute it</li>
